			% This force comes from "A dynamic cell model for the formation of epithelial
			% tissues", Nagai, Honda 2001. It comes from section 2.2 "Resistance force against
			% cell deformation". This force will push to cell to a target area. If left unchecked
			% the cell will end up at it's target area, unlike the "Adhesion" force, which
			% will send the cell to a point. The equation governing this energy is
			% U = \rho h_0^2 (A - A_0)^2
			% Here \rho is a area energy parameter, h_0 is the equilibrium height (in 3D)
			% and A_0 is the equilibrium area.

			% This energy allows the cell to compress, but penalises the compression quadratically
			% The cyctoplasm of a cell is mostly water, so can be assumed incompressible, but
			% the bilipid membrane can have all sorts of molecules on its surface that
			% may exhibit some compressibility

			% The resulting force comes from taking the -ve divergence of the energy, and using
			% a cross-product method of finding the area of a given polygon. This results in:
			% -\sum_{i} \rho h_0^2 (A - A_0)^2 * [r_{acw} - r_{cw}] x k
			% Where r_{acw} and r_{cw} are vectors to the nodes anticlockwise and clockwise
			% respectively of the node i, and k is a unit normal vector perpendicular to the
			% plane of the nodes, and oriented by the right hand rule where anticlockwise is
			% cw -> i -> acw. The cross product produces a vector in the plane perpendicular
			% to r_{acw} - r_{cw}, and pointing out of the cell at node i

			% Practically, for each node in a cell, we take the cw and acw nodes, find the
			% vector cw -> acw, find it's perpendicular vector, and apply a force along
			% this vector according to the area energy parameter and the dA from equilibrium

			targetArea 			= c.GetCellTargetArea();

			n = c.nodeList(1);

			% This force comes from Chaste, and apparently it was sourced from a later Nagai Honda

			% I feel like this is exactly the same as the "adhesion" force, except for the
			% tendency to a given perimeter, rather than a zero length edge

			% In fact, it is precisely the same as "adhesion" force, except it applies to the
			% whole perimeter length, node the individual element length

			% In the context of a 2D model...

			%%% THIS IS A MESH REGULARISING FORCE - IT SHOULD BE REMOVED AND TREATED AS
			%%% SUCH. IT WILL TEND TO MAKE THE ELEMENTS OF A CELL A UNIFORM SIZE, SO IT
			%%% IS STILL HGHLY USEFUL, BUT SHOULD NOT BE TREATED AS A PHYSICAL FORCE

			% This force comes from "A dynamic cell model for the formation of epithelial
			% tissues", Nagai, Honda 2001. It comes from section 2.1 "Tension of the cell boundary"
			% and is a force resulting from the tendency to minimise the energy held in
			% the boundary of the cell. If left unchecked, this will drive the boundary
			% of the cell to zero. The equation governing the energy is:
			% U = \sum_{j} \sigma_{\alpha,\beta} |r_{i} - r_{j}|
			% i is a given node around a cell boundary, j are the nodes that share an edge with i
			% \sigma_{\alpha,\beta} is the energy per unit length of the edge between
			% cells \alpha and \beta.

			% The resulting force comes by taking the -ve gradient of the energy, giving
			% -\sigma_{\alpha,\beta} (r_{i} - r_{j}) / |r_{i} - r_{j}|

			% Since the parameter \sigma is specified for any cell pair, it can be used
			% as a way for any two cells to minimise their shared boundary. If used this way
			% it should also account for the tendency for adhesion between two cells, meaning
			% that the parameter could go negative.

			% Here it will be used as a tendency for a cell to want to minimise it boundary in
			% general. Adhesion forces will be dealt separately.

			% Practically, the force means for any given element, it's nodes will be pulled together.
			% In terms of the node, we will find a force pointing towards any other node that
			% it shares an edge with.

			% Technically this can be separated out as an AbstractElementBasedForce, but it is kept
			% here since it is part of the "Nagai-Honda" model of a cell.


			% Elements are organised so Node1 -> Node2 is anticlockwise
			for i = 1:length(c.elementList)

				e = c.elementList(i);
				r = e.GetVector1to2();

				f = obj.edgeAdhesionParameter * r;

				e.Node2.AddForceContribution(-f);
