<<How does a healthy crypt work?>>
	Cells are produced at the bottom of the crypt in the stem cell niche. They proliferate and migrate
	up the crypt until they terminally differentiate. Once they have reached the top of the crypt they
	die and are sloughed off at the crypt collar or they continue to migrate up the villi, where they
	die at the top. There are two regions where crypts are found, the small intestine and the large
	intestine (colon). There are differences between the two types
	{What are the differences, and specifically how do colonic crypts work?}
	<<What is its general structure?>>
		A healthy crypt has a *basement membrane*. The epithelial cells sit on the BM. The BM is
		roughly test tube shaped. The base of the tube is attached to the *muscularis mucosa* which
		cups around the base. It is one or two cells thick.
		Around the BM is a pericryptal *fibroblast sheath* (Fibroblasts produce the stroma i.e. the
		ECM and collagen). Between crypts are stromal cells.
		The PCFS produces Wnt which gets into the crypt somehow. In the mouse, there are roughly 38 PCFS
		cells per small intestine crypt, and 124 per colonic crypt.
		{How does Wnt get into the crypt from outside the BM?}
	<<What cells sit on the BM?>>
		There are at least 5 types of cell in the crypt: 
			*Paneth* cells, *Lgr5+* cells -> both are stem -ish and are found in the bottom of the crypt
			*Goblet* cells -> these produce mucus
			*Enterocytes/Coloncytes*: Columnar Absorptive cells that produce enzymes for digestion
			*Enteroendocrine* Cells: Release hormones to regulate digestive enzymes
		Transit Amplifying cells:
			Occupy the lower two thirds (not exactly the bottom, but probably appear there)
			They proliferate and move up the crypt wall, at a certain height, they are termnially
			differentiated and stop dividing
			They become Paneth, Goblet, Colono, or Enteroendocrine
		<<How do they know to stop dividing?>>
			It is theorised that as they ascend the crypt when the Wnt concentration drops below a
			certain threshold, TA cells termnially differentiate. {verify}
			The original cell undergoes around 4 to 5 divisions along the way {verify}
		{How do they know what to become?}
		<<What makes them move up the crypt?>>
			Mitotic pressure is suggested i.e. the force of new cells squeezing their way in between 
			{verify}
		{What physical properties do the different cells have?}
	<<What chemical signals are involved?>>
		Wnt
		Notch
		NF-kB
		PI3 K/Akt
		TGF-b
		Ras-MAPK
	<<What do each of these do?>>
		Wnt governs proliferation and cellular adhesion
		{Can you expand on that and quantify?}
		Notch relates to proliferation
		{How does it do it and what specifically does it do?}
		NF-kB relates to growth, apoptosis and cell inflamation response
		{Need more details}
		PI3 K/Akt cell proliferation and survival signalling
		{Expand on this, and what is survival signalling}
		TGF-b - no info
		{Find out}
		Ras-MAPK - no info
		{Find out}
	{What happens when each of these get disrupted?}

	{What are the physical properties of the BM?}
		{How does it grow, and what causes growth?}
		{How strong is the membrane?}
		{How permeable is it to signals?}
		{How do cells adhere to it?}
		{How does it know what shape to take on?}
	{Which type of crypt are we most interested in? Small intestine or colon?}

<<What do these pathological crypts look like?>>
	There are several types of polyps that contain pathological crypts
	Micro Vesical Hyperplastic polyps
	Goblet Cell Hyperplastic Polyp
	Sessile Serrated Adenoma/Polyp
	Sessile Serrated Adenoma with Displaysia
	<<What is wrong with these crypts?>>
		MVHP:
			Stellate crypt openings
			Thickening of of "superficial" BM abd MM
			{What does superficial mean in this context?}
			Sometimes vertically oriented strips of smooth muscle between crypts
			Prolifereative zone expanded
			V600E BRAF mutation - shortens the cell cycle
			Burst of Proliferative activity and supression of apoptosis
			{What kind of apoptosis?}
		GCHP:
			Thickened mucosa
			crowded crypts
			Many more mature goblet cells
			Thickening of BM and MM
		SSA/P:
			L or T shaped crypts
			Irregular crypt spacing
			Serration down to the bottom third
			Herniation into the submucosa
			Asymmetric proliferative zones
			{What does this mean?}
			Mature goblet and faveolar cells at the top and bottom

	{What kind of cells make up the serrations? TA cells?}
	{Where is the BM in the serrations?}
	{Is the BM intact in serrated areas?}

<<What can you model?>>
	In Chaste I can model the interaction force between cells (this ultimately determines cell shape),
	the cell cycle, signal gradients, cell death, 
	hopefully cell migration, cell mutations, cell types
<<What can't you model?>>
	3D things, membranes in their own right (done with forces or regular sized cells), genes and
	genetic mutations
	<<What limitations does this impose>>
		We need to approximate to 2D, we need to know the resultant cellular level effects of gene
		mutations
	<<What are the consequnces for your research, your model and eventual results?>>
		I need to do a lot of digging to find the cellular level effects, they are not easy to find
		The model needs to be validated somehow, i.e. that 2D is good enough to represent the 3D real
		world


	{How can you model cell migration?}
	{How can the basement membrane be modelled?}
