must implement void CheckAndLabelCellsForApoptosisOrDeath()


loop through the cells and check if it's popped up

if it has, mark it for death in a list with the cell pointer and the time it popped up

at each step loop through the list and kill all the cells that are past their death time

if a cell has the anoikis resistant mutation they will die later

can set a radius here for collecting neighbours - will be handy for determining how far out cells can pop before anoikis kicks in
